# A No-RM for Clojure and Mongo. [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/circleci/mongofinil.png?style=badge)](https://circleci.com/gh/circleci/mongofinil)

Mongofinil reads a declarative specification of your models, and generates a namespaced DSL for that model.

It takes some inspiration from Mongoid, from the Rails world, but attempts to be idiomatic clojure.

### Usage

At CircleCI we are migrating away from this library and we no longer update it. We cannot recommend using it.
